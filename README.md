# Fluid-SegNet
This repository contains the official implementation of Fluid-SegNet: Multi-Dimensional Loss-Driven Y-Net with Dilated Convolutions for OCT B-scan Fluid Segmentation.
We propose Fluid-SegNet, a deep learning model specifically designed to segment fluid regions from OCT B-scan images. Our approach addresses several key challenges in fluid segmentation, including:

Difficulty in capturing fine-grained fluid structures,

High heterogeneity of fluid regions,

Computational overhead when incorporating rich contextual information.

By introducing a multi-dimensional loss function and leveraging dilated convolutions within a Y-Net architecture, Fluid-SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in fluid region segmentation.

Below is the architecture diagram of Fluid-SegNet:
